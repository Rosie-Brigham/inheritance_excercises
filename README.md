inheritance_excercises
======================

A collection of specs for learning inheritance and modules in Ruby.


1: Boxes: Basic Inheritance
---------------------------

Firstly, make the box_spec pass by building an implementation of Box.

Then, make another class MagicBox. MagicBox should inherit from Box, but overwrite the #shake method to turn contents into something else!

2: Life: Complex Inheritance
----------------------------

There are a set of specs in the life folder that describe four classes: Animal, Reptile, Turtle and GrassSkink.

Implement four classes that inherit from each other in a logical way, and add functionality to make the specs pass.
